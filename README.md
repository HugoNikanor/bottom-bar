Bottom Bar
==========
A raw terminal can have the problem that the font doesn't
exactly line up with the screen. This program solves this by
displaying some graphics in the last bottom pixels.

Currently it can display both a battery indicator, and a
game of Tetris, but requires recompilation to change between
them.

It also currently is hard coded to fit my laptop screen and
font. So that might be a problem if your screen isn't
1280x800 pixels large and use a font of 8x12 px.
